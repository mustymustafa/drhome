## Running on real device

## OPTION 1

1. download expo go app from app store or google play store
2. sign in with my demo account username: musty, password: musty100
3. connect your device to the same wifi as your laptop or use a usb cable
4. run the app from you laptop and you will see it appear on your expo go app
5. tip: make sure your device is in light mode. Dark mode wasn't implemented in the prpject

## OPTION 2 
 using expo EAS
 1. login to the expo go app
 2. scroll down to the dr home project and open it
 3. p.s put your phone in light mode..i didn't handle dark mode theme in the project

i setup a boilerplate yaml file which can be used to automate build process and app store submission

## Design system

   i made use of atomic design system. It follows the structure of an atom. Creating Themed components allows us to reuse components while maintaning the same look and feeel across the app

## EXPO EAS update

```bash
   Example can be seen in the running on a real device OPTION 2
```

I included a sample expo eas config file. EAS is useful for OTA updates (This allows you release a new version of your app instantly). eas is also used for creating builds and submitting to the app store

## Error handling

I also included a global error handler. This helps to handle crashes safely and also sending the error to an error monitoring tool like sentry or even slack. This can help when the app goes to production to be notified whenver the app crashes
